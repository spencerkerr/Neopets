Neopets Tracker
=======

Neopets Tracker is a Simple Visual Basic program that tracks the number of habitarium eggs stored in the bag 
as well as the number of red codestones in my SDB.

Updates:

Added calculator for the resources it takes to dump a number of nests in Habitarium.
Added price values to codestones to track the regular price of codestones on the SW.

Might add more things to it eventually.
